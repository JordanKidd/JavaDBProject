------ PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: --------------------------------------------------
Dear all, 

I got emails asking what the format of your project presentation shall be. 

Basically you are free to show us whatever you think your project shines. 
A suggested list may include: 

1. background (purpose of your project, requirement, problem/challenge, 
database design, etc.) 
2. dbms software, tools, and languages used and why you choose them 
3. show us your code 
4. a demo of the code (required) 
5. share with us your experience and what you have learned 

You'll receive grade based on your project presentation. You do not need to 
submit any report. 

Dr. Li Yang
